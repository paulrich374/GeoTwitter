Google-Maps-and-Flickr-API
==========================

Imagine you've made the beautiful map a client requested; adding all sorts of interesting markers, pop-ups, custom overlays and photos.Â  But then the client mentions they want to be able to add their own photos without either troubling you, or doing any coding themselves. This is where the Flickr API comes in very handy.
